## Description of the game
A player controls a snake that moves in a grid shaped ground, whose length increases by one unit when it collects targets that are periodically generated in the grid.<br/>
The game ends when one of the following conditions is satisfied. Either the snake collides with one of the obstacles(Grid border/Snake body) or time is out.<br/>
The game has an infinite number of levels, whose difficulty increases accordingly.<br/>

2nd level, Adding on level 1, random obstacles are generated in the grid.<br/>
3rd level, Adding on level 2, the random obstacles periodically change their positions.<br/>
4th level till infinity, the snake speed and the frequency of generating obstacles <br/>
increases by a factor over the previous level.<br/>
